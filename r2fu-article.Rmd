# Introduction

Experiences of stress, anxiety, and depression are often associated with avoidance. A person who is all too stressed from an ever-increasing workload may want nothing more than to tell their supervisor there are too many tasks on the table, yet still takes on another assignment when the supervisor asks. A person with social anxiety may want nothing more than to take part in social gatherings, yet chooses to abstain to avoid the feeling of being judged or scrutinized by others. A person who is depressed may want nothing more than to call a friend, yet chooses not to, as to not risk being put down if the friend were to not pick up the phone. These behaviors may all be associated with inadequate assertiveness, i.e., avoidance of constructively presenting one’s thoughts, feelings, needs, and wishes in relation to others.

Assertiveness can be difficult to delineate from social skills in general (Linehan, 1979), but a common definition is “direct, firm, positive [...] action [enabling] us to act in our own best interests, to stand up for ourselves without undue anxiety, to exercise personal rights without denying the rights of others, and to express our feelings and needs [...] honestly and comfortably” [@alberti2017your,p.34]. Examples include politely saying ‘no’ to a boss requesting undue overtime, actively participating in social activities, accepting/acknowledging a compliment without deflecting, and verbalizing feelings in personal relationships without acting out. Lack of assertiveness is associated with several psychological problems, including stress, anxiety, depression, and panic disorder, as well as emotional instability, strained relationships, and low self-esteem [@Speed2018a]. While there are diagnoses, diagnostic tools, and treatment manuals for these conditions, no evidence-based interventions specifically target assertiveness for a broader population.

Assertiveness training in general, however, goes back to the very first behavioral therapies, for example, as described by @salter1949conditioned or @Wolpe1966. Assertiveness was presented as a behavioristic alternative to psychoanalysis. In the 1970s, the concept was popularized in self-help books by @alberti1974your, @smith1975say, as well as @fensterheim1975don. Research in assertiveness training peaked in the 1980s [@Speed2018a]. Although the behavioral techniques of the first wave of therapy were supplemented by cognitive restructuring techniques [e.g. @beck1979cognitive] in the following decades, techniques such as modeling and behavior rehearsal have remained active parts of treatments for psychological syndromes such as anxiety disorders and depression. The @LINEHAN1979 manual for assertion therapy combining behavior rehearsal with cognitive restructuring was a stepping stone towards Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), of which assertion skills training in a group setting is an integral part @linehan1993skills.

(Säga något här om ev för- och nackdelar med transdiagnostiska behandlingsmål jämfört med syndromal symptomreduktion som mål, relatera till ex ACT och Rozentals prokrastineringsmål? Kolla upp vad forskningen säger här.)

Building on the definition from @alberti2017your, assertiveness can be operationalized as acting with respect to both personal rights and rights of others. Assertion, when made in a constructive way, thus takes into account not only the expected result of the interaction (e.g. having said no to someone else’s demand, or having made a request) but also negotiates the strength of the interaction with regards to both the importance of the relationship (e.g. “Having stated my refusal/request, what do I want the other person to think of me?”) and what @linehan1993skills refers to as ‘self-respect’ (“Having stated my refusal/request, what do I want to think of myself?”). Assertive behavior, using this definition, can be thought of the product of respect of rights of others, and respect of rights of self. This definition offers plenty of opportunities for idiographic and contextual descriptions of assertion in therapy, i.e. when designing in vivo behavioral experiments, regardless of cultural influences on what is considered to be acceptable behavior (within a family, community, society, et.c.).

@Speed2018a conclude that while assertiveness training remains part of DBT, as well as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), general assertiveness training has otherwise fallen into oblivion in favor of interventions designed for specific psychiatric disorders. Very little research on assertiveness training has been published since the early 1980s. Recent exceptions include @Baker2015, showing a negative relationship between social anxiety and assertiveness, and @Vagos2019 showing a negative relationship between mental distress in general and assertiveness. @Speed2018a further conclude that there is potential for assertiveness training as an intervention for individuals suffering from anxiety and depression, and as a means to increase relationship satisfaction. The lack of contemporary evidence for the assertiveness construct and assertiveness training as a transdiagnostic intervention calls for new research on the subject.

The Western Australian Centre for Clinical Interventions (CCI) offers various self-help resources for mental health problems. These resources include Assert Yourself [@michel2008], a series of ten modules with concepts and strategies primarily based on CBT, with a focus on assertiveness. While current evidence for assertiveness training is scarce, at best, there is great evidence for CBT for symptoms and syndromes associated with inadequate assertiveness. In a review of meta-analyses, @Hofmann2012 conclude that CBT is one of the most effective forms of therapy. This includes the application for symptoms related to trauma and stress, as well as syndromes related to depression and anxiety. A review by @Andrews2018 also lends support to internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) for anxiety and depression, showing an average between-group effect size g = 0.8, compared to controls. @Carlbring2018 have also shown that iCBT, on average, produces equivalent overall effects compared to face-to-face treatment. Both guided and unguided iCBT (i.e., with or without therapist support) have been shown to be effective, though guided iCBT tends to produce slightly larger effects [@Baumeister2014a]. iCBT has further been proven effective in transdiagnostic applications, including interventions targeting stress [@Day2013], procrastination [@Rozental2015], and perfectionism [@Rozental2017].

This study aims to evaluate the effects of an eight-week iCBT intervention for assertiveness, Respekt^2^, based on the @michel2008 modules, through a randomized controlled trial. The research questions are:

- What are the effects on assertiveness (adaptive, aggressive, and aggregated) of guided and unguided participation in Respect^2^, compared to a waitlist control?

- What are the effects of guided and unguided participation on measures of anxiety and depression, compared to the control?

# Method

## Ethics and pre-registration

Before recruitment started, the study received ethics approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Diary number: 2019-05165). The study was pre-registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04240249).

## Design

```{r powercalc, echo = F, eval = F}

round(pwr.f2.test(
  u = 3,
  v = NULL, # Solve for sample size
  f2 = 0.8,
  power = 0.9,
  sig.level = 0.05
)$v / 0.85 ^ 8,
digits = -1) * 3

```

The study design follows the RCT criteria proposed by @Chambless2001, with a randomized allocation of participants to three groups: (1) Guided self-help intervention, (2) Self-help intervention (unguided), and (3) a ten-week Waitlist control. A sample size of 210 (70 per group) was decided on through an a priori power calculation according to guidelines for linear models set forth in @cohen1988statistical, assuming a between-group effect size of Cohen’s d of 0.8 on Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales (AAA-S; @Thompson2011), power 0.9, alpha 0.05, and a 15% drop-out rate per week, with a duration of the intervention of 8 weeks in total.

## Participants

Participants were recruited from the public through advertisements on social media and other websites. Interested individuals were referred to a purpose-built website with more information on the study, including criteria for participation. Participants were required to be Swedish citizens, at least 18 years of age, have access to the internet, and be fluent in Swedish. Information on the website also included risks associated with participation, as well as terms and conditions for participation. People were invited to submit their email addresses and those who did were sent a link to complete online screening. The online self-report screening battery included measures of anxiety, depression, and assertiveness, as well as questions regarding socio-demographics, experiences of psychological treatment, any current medication, and motivation for participation.

In total, 657 individuals submitted their email addresses, of which 464 completed the screening questionnaire. Among those, 126 were excluded for meeting exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria were concurrent psychological treatment, a recent change in psychotropic medication, lack of time and/or motivation for participation, and a rating of 15 or above on the PHQ-9 measure of depression. The remaining 338 individuals were invited to participate in the study. Of those, 253 accepted the invitation.

## Procedure

In accordance with the a priori power calculation, 210 participants were randomized to be included in the study. The remaining 43 individuals were offered access to treatment materials but were excluded from all analyses. The 210 participants were randomized to the three treatment conditions. Participants in the guided condition were randomized to one of two therapists. All randomization was performed by an independent third party at Stockholm University, using the online services random.org [@RandomOrg] and sealedenvelope.com [@sealed].

## Measures

Measurements were collected using the below scales pre treatment (week 0), midway during the intervention (week 4), post treatment (week 8), and at 1 year follow-up.

### Primary measures

Assertiveness style was measured using a Swedish translation (contributed by TH) of the Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales (AAA-S; @Thompson2011) which contained 30 items, including “When someone I don’t know well borrows something from me and forgets to return it, I… a. Demand it back b. Ask if she/he is done and ask for it back” (a. and b. both scored 1 = Never, 5 = Always). The AAA-S has good and excellent internal consistency for aggressive (0.88) and adaptive (0.93) assertiveness, respectively. A Swedish translation (contributed by TH) of the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (RAS; @Rathus1973) was used as an additional measure of assertiveness style with 30 items, including “I find it embarrassing to return merchandise”, (+3 = Very characteristic of me, extremely descriptive, -3 = Very uncharacteristic of me, extremely nondescriptive).

### Secondary measures

Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; @Kroenke2010) which contained nine items, including “Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless” (0 = Not at all, 3 = Nearly every day). Anxiety was measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale (GAD-7; @Kroenke2006) which contained seven items, including “Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge” (0 = Not at all, 3 = Nearly every day). Social anxiety was measured using the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS-SR; @Fresco2001) which contained 24 items, including “Calling someone you don’t know very well” (Fear or anxiety, 0 = None, 3 = Severe; Avoidance, 0 = Never, 3 = Usually). These self-report measures have reported either good or excellent internal consistency (0.87, 0.89, 0.92, and 0.96, respectively).

## Intervention

The intervention was based on the Assert Yourself modules by @michel2008, adapted to Swedish by TH with permission from the copyright holders. The self-help material teaches the distinction between different types of assertiveness (constructive, aggressive, passive, and passive-aggressive). It also aids the reader in finding reasons to act more assertive and constructive. The material is inspired by and cites works by @alberti1974your, @gambrill1975assertion, and @smith1975say, among others. In the material, assertiveness is described and operationalized based on the theoretic assumptions by @wolpe1990practice regarding reciprocal inhibition and classic conditioning: By assertively practicing the expression of feelings, wishes, and demands in anxiety-evoking situations and relationships (where the person previously were prone to non-assertive behaviors, e.g., subdued disappointment or anger), a person may experience less discomfort from autonomous anxiety responses, over time. This is to be practiced in vivo, not just by acting. The long-term goal is to learn how to inhibit anxiety by being assertive. In cases where a physical counterpart is missing and anxiety is invoked by places, objects, or words, @Wolpe1952 suggests relaxation as a means to inhibit the anxiety response.

The material also includes a rationale for cognitive restructuring with methods by @beck1979cognitive, @Clark1986, @clark1995cognitive, and @powell2017mental. Through behavioral experiments, readers are to test the validity of negative thoughts, with the purpose of achieving greater flexibility in responses. Furthermore, the material includes a passage on progressive muscle relaxation, for the reader to recognize bodily tension, reduce general strain, and practice an active coping technique for stressful situations. Finally, chapters on specific challenges, such as saying no, dealing with criticism, and coping with disappointment, conclude the material.

The Swedish adaptation prompted some additions to @michel2008, some of which are presented in this paragraph. Based on recent research on exposure and inhibitory learning (e.g., @Craske2008), participants were encouraged to actively vary learning situations and work on new skills in as many environments as possible. In another new passage, inspired by the works on acceptance by Hayes [e.g., -@Hayes2004a] and others, participants were encouraged to actively search for and remain in the respondent discomfort they previously avoided. In line with Öst’s [-@ost2006tillampad] recommendations for applied tension, progressive muscle relaxation was introduced early in the intervention and expanded over several weeks. The written material was also complemented by downloadable audio with relaxation exercises, video of conversations and role-playing, and several new, interactive exercises.

Additional support for participants in the guided Self-help condition included weekly messages in the treatment platform, including homework feedback, encouragement, validation, psychoeducation, and answers to any questions. Time for guiding participants was allocated not to require more than 15 minutes per participant and week.

### Therapists

Both therapists supporting participants in the guided condition were final-year psychology students at Stockholm University, training to become clinical psychologists. Both had completed basic training in CBT and received continuous supervision from a licensed psychotherapist with more than two decades of iCBT experience.

## Data preparation

Five participants were excluded from the analyses due to wrongful inclusion as they were receiving concurrent psychological treatment.

## Analysis

All data were organized in one dataset and analyzed using `r R.Version()$language` `r paste(R.Version()[c("major", "minor")], collapse = ".")`, using lmerTest [@R-lmerTest], emmeans [@R-emmeans], ggeffects [@R-ggeffects], performance [@R-performance], and clinicalsignificance [@R-clinicalsignificance] packages. All syntax is available at https://github.com/hmep/r2fu/, together with anonymized data. 

A linear mixed-effects model was fitted using unscaled data to estimate fixed effects of group, time, and group-time interaction, and random effects of participant (random intercept), using an unstructured covariance pattern, and the REML method of estimation. Kenward-Roger approximations were used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means were performed using T-tests with Bonferroni-corrected p-values. The proportions of participants showing reliable change and reaching clinical significance were determined in accordance with @Jacobson1991, using the 'c' definition to select the cutoff value. To honor the intention to treat principle in the analysis of clinical significance, any missing value was filled in with the value from the previous time point.

## Treatment efficacy, primary and secondary measures

Mixed models for two of three primary measures of assertive behaviors revealed time \texttimes{} group interaction effects: The Adaptive subscale of AAA-S, `r report.anova(aaas_ad.anova)[3]`, and the RAS, `r report.anova(rathus.anova)[3]`, suggesting that participation in the treatment conditions did have an effect over time on assertive behaviors. However, the model for Aggressive subscale of AAA-S  did not, `r report.anova(aaas_ag.anova)[3]`, indicating that the self-assessed expressed or perceived levels of aggressive assertions were not affected by participation in the intervention. Similarily, mixed models for two secondary measures of syndromal symptoms, PHQ-9 and LSAS-SR, revealed time \texttimes{} group interaction effects, `r report.anova(phq_sum.anova)[3]`, and `r report.anova(lsas_sum.anova)[3]` respectively, while the model for GAD-7 did not, `r report.anova(gad_sum.anova)[3]`, indicating that estimated mean levels of depressive mood and social anxiety symptoms -- but not those of generalized anxiety -- were significantly affected by participation in the intervention. 

### Within-group effects

For the primary transdiagnostic measures of skillful behaviors it is notable that both treatment groups Self-help and Guided self-help improved significantly during the course of the intervention, showing large within-group effects with regards to AAA-S Adaptive from Pre to Post, `r report.text2(aaas_ad.out, "(Pre Self-help) - (Post Self-help)", -1)`, and `r report.text2(aaas_ad.out, "Pre Support - Post Support", -1)` respectively. For the RAS, significant large effects on assertiveness were also found in the Self-help group, `r report.text2(rathus.out, "(Pre Self-help) - (Post Self-help)", -1)`, and the Guided self-help group, `r report.text2(rathus.out, "Pre Support - Post Support", -1)`. 
<!-- Means in the Waitlist condition did not change between Pre and Post with regards to either AAA-S Adaptive or the RAS, `r xprnot(aaas_ad.out$emmpairs$p.value[2])` and `r xprnot(rathus.out$emmpairs$p.value[2])` respectively.  -->
Both treatment groups showed sustained within-group effects on assertiveness at 1 year Follow-up when compared to the Pre-treatment measurement time point, measured with AAA-S Adaptive and the RAS, suggesting that assertive behaviors were still manifest well beyond the end of participation in the intervention. However, only in the Guided self-help group was the Post to Follow-up comparison in itself significant for AAA-S Adaptive and the RAS, `r report.text2(aaas_ad.out, "Post Support - (Follow-up Support)", -1)` and `r report.text2(rathus.out, "Post Support - (Follow-up Support)", -1)` respectively. For the other comparisons, there was no difference between Post and Follow-up time points in either group, from `r xprnot(rathus.out$emmpairs$p.value[41])` to `r xprnot(aaas_ag.out$emmpairs$p.value[55])`. This indicates, with regards to adaptive assertiveness, that therapist support provided some benefit to participants' ability to generalize behaviors beyond the duration of the intervention. Table 1 summarizes significance tests of estimated marginal mean differences and effect sizes.

Among the secondary measures of syndromal symptoms, depression as captured with PHQ-9 had decreased significantly from Pre only in the Guided self-help group, and only at Follow-up, `r report.text2(phq_sum.out, "Pre Support - (Follow-up Support)", 1)`, possibly indicating that therapist support benefits depressed participants on a longer rather than shorter time scale. Symptoms of social anxiety, however, decreased significantly for all four combinations of time points and groups. In the Self-help group, the effect from Pre to Post was `r report.text2(lsas_sum.out, "(Pre Self-help) - (Post Self-help)", 1)`, increasing to `r report.text2(lsas_sum.out, "(Pre Self-help) - (Follow-up Self-help)", 1)` Pre to Follow-up. In the Guided self-help group, the effect from Pre to Post was `r report.text2(lsas_sum.out, "Pre Support - Post Support", 1)`, increasing to `r report.text2(lsas_sum.out, "Pre Support - (Follow-up Support)", 1)` Pre to Follow-up. Although effect sizes for LSAS-SR was larger Pre--Follow-up than Pre--Post, there was no significant difference between Post and Follow-up in either group, `r xprnot(lsas_sum.out$emmpairs$p.value[41])` for Self-help and `r xprnot(lsas_sum.out$emmpairs$p.value[55])` for Guided self-help, suggesting that change in relief from symptoms of social phobia plateaued earlier than did change in manifest expressions of adaptive assertiveness. The within-group effects taken together indicate that the intervention was effective at addressing more contextually specific anxiety-induced avoidance and escape behaviors, replacing them with already desired assertive behaviors, to a larger extent than it was effective at helping participants struggling with generalized anxiety or depression to formulate reasons to start responding more flexibly.

### Between-group effects

Comparing against Waitlist, the effect of the Self-help condition on adaptive assertiveness using the AAA-S Adaptive primary measure was large at Post-treatment, `r report.text2(aaas_ad.out, "Post Waitlist - (Post Self-help)", -1)`, and even larger at 1-year Follow-up,  `r report.text2(aaas_ad.out, "Post Waitlist - (Follow-up Self-help)", -1)`. Similar effects at Post were found for the primary RAS measure `r report.text2(rathus.out, "Post Waitlist - (Post Self-help)", -1)`, and at Follow-up,  `r report.text2(rathus.out, "Post Waitlist - (Follow-up Self-help)", -1)`. These effects were not significantly different from those of the Guided self-help condition for AAA-S Adaptive, which compared against Waitlist were `r report.text2(aaas_ad.out, "Post Waitlist - Post Support", -1)` at Post, and  `r report.text2(aaas_ad.out, "Post Waitlist - (Follow-up Support)", -1)` at Follow-up, suggesting that participants working through the intervention on their own fared just as well as those who were supported by a therapist. The same phenomenon, and a large effect size, was observed on the RAS in the Guided self-help group, `r report.text2(rathus.out, "Post Waitlist - Post Support", -1)` at Post, and  `r report.text2(rathus.out, "Post Waitlist - (Follow-up Support)", -1)` at Follow-up. When it comes to assertive behaviors, excluding aggressive assertions, participants benefited from participation in the intervention, regardless of treatment condition. 

Again comparing against Waitlist, there was no significant effect of the Self-help condition on reduction of social anxiety symptoms measured with LSAS-SR at Post-treatment, `r xprnot(lsas_sum.out$emmpairs$p.value[22])`, however, a large effect was found at Follow-up, `r report.text2(lsas_sum.out, "During Waitlist - (Follow-up Self-help)", 1)`, comparing against the lowest value collected (at During, half-way through the intervention, in order to cancel out any possible nocebo effect of the Waitlist condition; see Figure 3 for a graphic identification of time point). No effect on alleviation of depressive symptoms measured with PHQ-9 at Post was found comparing Waitlist and Self-help groups, `r  xprnot(phq_sum.out$emmpairs$p.value[22])`. Some evidence was found suggesting that depressive participants might benefit from therapist support, in that the Waitlist versus Guided self-help comparison for PHQ-9 revealed a medium to large sized effect at Post, `r report.text2(phq_sum.out, "Post Waitlist - Post Support", 1)`. However, this effect dissipated when the Follow-up comparison was instead made against the most conservative value collected in the Waitlist group (in this case Pre instead of Post; see Figure 3 for a graphic exploration of a possible nocebo effect, that is symptomatic worsening over time due to self-fulfilling expectations of hopelessness among participants waiting in line for treatment). Thus, the between-group effect on depression at Post should be interpreted with caution.

#### Clinical significant change

Adding to the picture that assertive behaviors increased and symptoms of depression and social phobia decreased as a consequence of participation in the intervention, there was a significant difference between the groups at Post in the number of participants that had recovered clinically, that is had moved across the cutoff for reliable and clinically significant change, with respect to AAA-S Adaptive, `r report.kw(aaas_ad.pre.post.kw)`;
RAS, `r report.kw(rathus.pre.post.kw)`, and LSAS-SR, `r report.kw(lsas_sum.pre.post.kw)`.  However, there was no difference between groups at Post with regards to AAA-S Aggressive, `r report.kwnot(aaas_ag.pre.post.kw)`, PHQ-9, `r report.kwnot(phq_sum.pre.post.kw)`, or GAD-7, `r report.kwnot(gad_sum.pre.post.kw)`. At Follow-up, the difference in recovery rates between conditions was significant for both behavioral and syndromal measures: AAA-S Adaptive, `r report.kw(aaas_ad.pre.fu.kw)`; RAS, `r report.kw(rathus.pre.fu.kw)`; PHQ-9, `r report.kw(phq_sum.pre.fu.kw)`; and LSAS-SR, `r report.kw(lsas_sum.pre.fu.kw)`; but not for AAA-S Aggressive, `r report.kwnot(aaas_ag.pre.fu.kw)` or GAD-7, `r report.kwnot(gad_sum.pre.fu.kw)`. See Table 2 for a summary of clinical recovery rates and the significance of pairwise tests against Waitlist. Notably, a number of participants, `r clinsigtext("aaas_ad", "higher", "Pre", "Post", "Self-help", aaas_ad.pre.post.kw)[1]` in the Self-help group enjoyed clinical recovery with regards to adaptive assertiveness measured with AAA-S Adaptive at Post, increasing to `r clinsigtext("aaas_ad", "higher", "Pre", "Follow-up", "Self-help", aaas_ad.pre.fu.kw)[1]` at Follow-up. In the Guided self-help group the number of recovered participants at Post was non-significantly different from that of the Waitlist, while significantly different at Followup, `r clinsigtext("aaas_ad", "higher", "Pre", "Follow-up", "Support", aaas_ad.pre.fu.kw)[1]`. For assertiveness assessed with the RAS, the corresponding number and rates were `r clinsigtext("rathus", "higher", "Pre", "Post", "Self-help", rathus.pre.post.kw)[1]` for Self-help and `r clinsigtext("rathus", "higher", "Pre", "Post", "Support", rathus.pre.post.kw)[1]` for Guided self-help at Post, increasing to `r clinsigtext("rathus", "higher", "Pre", "Follow-up", "Self-help", rathus.pre.fu.kw)[1]` and `r clinsigtext("rathus", "higher", "Pre", "Follow-up", "Support", rathus.pre.fu.kw)[1]` respectively at Follow-up. Thus, the clinical significance findings are in agreement with the statistical analysis of change, confirming that adaptive expressions of assertiveness increased Pre to Post in both treatment groups. Clinical recovery measured with PHQ-9 Pre to Post indicate that the intervention, compared to Waitlist, was effective in moving a number of participants out of depression in the Guided self-help group, `r clinsigtext("phq_sum", "lower", "Pre", "Post", "Support", phq_sum.pre.post.kw)[1]`, but not so in Self-help group, pointing to that interaction with therapists might contribute to faster recovery for depressed participants. In addition, a significant number of participants in the Self-help group recovered from symptoms of social anxiety as captured with LSAS-SR, `r clinsigtext("lsas_sum", "lower", "Pre", "Post", "Self-help", lsas_sum.pre.post.kw)[1]` at Post, increasing to `r clinsigtext("lsas_sum", "lower", "Pre", "Follow-up", "Self-help", lsas_sum.pre.fu.kw)[1]` at Follow-up. In the Guided self-help condition, there was no significant number of recovered participants compared to Waitlist at Post, but `r clinsigtext("lsas_sum", "lower", "Pre", "Follow-up", "Support", lsas_sum.pre.fu.kw)[1]` at Follow-up. These clinical findings seem to pick up that symptoms of social anxiety continued to subside in the year following treatment to the point that some participants had recovered clinically. Combined with the clinically relevant recovery for assertive behaviors measured with AAA-S Adaptive and RAS, this could be a sign of generalization of assertive behaviors having continued to occur after the end of treatment, facilitating extinction of those anxiety responses that were captured with LSAS-SR.

# Discussion



Lösrykta tankar/stycken att utveckla och sammanfoga till en helhet:

- Samla upp viktigaste punkterna från uppsatsen.

- Problematisering av otydlig defintion av assertivenss. R2? Adaptiv, aggressiv? Passiv? Passiv-aggressiv? Icke-undvikande/icke-flykt? Det enda som är säkert är att definitionen nog endast bör rymma overta beteenden?

- Man kan ha olika uppfattning om vad som är aggressiv vs adaptiv självhävdelse, finns behov av att mäta dessa antaganden på något adekvat sätt. Att följa upp?

- Skalorna är inte validerade på svenska.

- Problem med ITT -- fångar inte ev försämring ... men vi får anta att regression to the mean gäller även här.

- Problematisering väntelista som kontroll, hantering av problem. It is noteworthy that the PHQ-9 mean of the non-active Waitlist control group increases as the participants wait in line to begin treatment; this might be due to the nocebo or ”reverse placebo” effect [@Furukawa2014;@Cuijpers2016], where participants’ expectations contribute to their mood actually worsening, which in turn risks inflating between group effect sizes. The other scales do not exhibit this possible problem. To mitigate any possible nocebo effect, the most conservative estimated marginal mean from either the Pre, During, Post time points was used for all within group pairwise comparisons for each scale.

- Jag vill säga något spekulativt om rimligheten och önskvärdheten att använda positivt formulerat, transdiagnostiskt beteendemål i behandling istf syndromal symptomreduktion. Relatera till utfallsmåtten PHQ9, GAD7, LSAS. Det är väntat att beteendemåtten (AAAS-ad/ag, RAS) sticker iväg snabbare än symtomreduktionsmåtten. Beteendeförändring borde föregå förändring i upplevelse (känslor, tankar). Validerar mao beteendeterapeutiska angreppssättet?

- För en replikering vore det intressant att använda andra transdiagnostiska skalor kopplade till värderat handlande, typ VLQ, och även SAAQ.

- En fördel med självständigt arbete (som när man går i ett självhjälpsprogram) är sannolikt att man tillskriver förbättringar till sig själv och egna förändrade beteenden än till kontakten med terapeuten -- skulle spekulativt kunna utgöra en del av förklaringen till att självshjälpsgruppen gjort så stora framsteg på egen hand när effekten mäts med positivt formulerade självhävdelsebeteendemål. Med andra ord synliggörs faktiska beteendeförändringar möjligen bättre.
