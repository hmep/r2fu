**Background.** Assertion training today makes up an important part of several flavors of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT), such as for social anxiety and in dialectical behavioral therapy. However, with few exceptions, the assertiveness construct has been neglected in clinical research. \quad{}**Objective.** To investigate the efficacy of an eight-week transdiagnostic stand-alone internet based CBT intervention, specifically aimed at increasing levels of assertive behavior. \quad{}**Methods.** After ethical approval, we randomized $N$ = 210 participants into three groups: therapist-guided self-help, unguided self-help, and a wait-list control condition. After one-year follow-up, we employed a linear mixed model to estimate the effects at both posttest and follow-up for the primary outcome measures of assertiveness, Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales, and the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, and secondary outcome measures of anxiety, depression, and general well-being. We also assessed and tested reliable clinical change. \quad{}**Results.** Compared to the wait-list at the post time point, estimated between-group effect sizes on self-rated adaptive assertiveness were statistically equivalent for the two treatment groups both at the post and at the one-year follow-up time points, ranging from $ES$ = 0.95 to $ES$ = 1.73, with reliable clinical recovery proportions from 19% to 36%. The increases in aggressive assertiveness ranged from $ES$ = --0.62 to $ES$ = --0.90 compared to the wait-list at post, although with no observed reliable clinical change. For social anxiety symptoms, the effects compared to the wait-list at post ranged from $ES$ = 0.67 to $ES$ = 0.93, with reliable clinical recovery from 16% to 26%. For self-assessed well-being, the effects compared to the wait-list at post ranged from $ES$ = 0.70 to $ES$ = 1.05. No effects were observed for generalized anxiety, although tentative within-group evidence was found for a medium effect on depression one year after treatment. Overall, the two treatment conditions produced similar effects. \quad{}**Conclusions.** In general, participation increased healthy assertive expressions regardless of treatment condition, thereby reducing self-assessed social anxiety, and over time possibly also depression, while improving general well-being. The findings demonstrate the viability of the assertiveness construct and of stand-alone self-help assertion training in the treatment of both psychiatric syndromes and non-syndromal problems in daily life, meriting further research. The study was preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04240249).
