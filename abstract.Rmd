**Background.** Assertion training today makes up an important part of several flavors of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy (CBT), such as for social anxiety and in dialectical behavioral therapy. However, with few exceptions, the assertiveness construct has been neglected in clinical research.\quad{}**Objective.** To investigate the efficacy of an eight-week transdiagnostic stand-alone internet based CBT intervention, specifically aimed at increasing levels of assertive behavior.\quad{}**Methods.** After ethical approval, we randomized $n$ = 210 participants into three groups: therapist-guided self-help, unguided self-help, and a wait-list control condition. After one-year follow-up, we employed a linear mixed model to estimate the effects at both posttest and follow-up for the primary outcome measures of assertiveness, Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales, and the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, and secondary outcome measures of anxiety and depression. We also assessed and tested reliable clinical change.\quad{}**Results.** Compared to the wait-list, estimated between-group effect sizes on self-rated adaptive assertiveness were statistically equivalent for the two treatment groups both at the post time point and at the one-year follow-up, ranging from $ES$ = 1.00 to $ES$ = 1.73, with reliable clinical recovery proportions from 19% to 36%. The effects for aggressive assertiveness ranged from $ES$ = 0.62 to $ES$ = 0.84, with no observed reliable clinical change. For social anxiety symptoms, the effects ranged from $ES$ = 0.90 to $ES$ = 0.95, with reliable clinical recovery from 16% to 26%. No effects were observed for generalized anxiety, but at follow-up, large effects were found also for symptoms of depression. Overall, the two treatment conditions produced similar effects.\quad{}**Conclusions.** In general, participation increased healthy assertive expressions, thereby reducing self-assessed social anxiety, and over time also depression. The findings demonstrate the viability of stand-alone self-help assertion training in the treatment of both psychiatric syndromes and non-syndromal problems in daily life, meriting further research. The study was preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04240249).
