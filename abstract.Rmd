**Background.** Assertiveness training has for a long time been an important component in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), for example in the treatment of social anxiety and in dialectical behavioral therapy. However, the assertiveness construct has garnered little attention in recent clinical research. \quad{}**Objective.** To investigate the efficacy of an eight-week transdiagnostic stand-alone internet based CBT intervention, specifically aimed at increasing levels of assertive behavior. \quad{}**Methods.** Following inclusion, we randomized $N$ = 210 participants into three groups: therapist-guided self-help, unguided self-help, and a wait-list control condition. After one-year follow-up, we employed a linear mixed model to estimate the effects at both posttest and follow-up for the primary outcome measures of assertiveness, Adaptive and Aggressive Assertiveness Scales, and the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, and secondary outcome measures of anxiety, depression, and general well-being. We also report reliable clinical change. \quad{}**Results.** Compared to the wait-list at the post treatment, estimated between-group effect sizes on self-rated adaptive assertiveness were statistically equivalent for the two treatment groups both at the post and at the one-year follow-up time points, ranging from $ES$ = 0.95 to $ES$ = 1.73, with reliable clinical recovery proportions from 19% to 36%. The increase in aggressive assertiveness ranged from $ES$ = --0.62 to $ES$ = --0.90 compared to the wait-list condition at post. For social anxiety symptoms, the effects compared to the wait-list at post treatment ranged from $ES$ = 0.67 to $ES$ = 0.93, with reliable clinical recovery from 16% to 26%. For self-assessed well-being, the effects compared to the wait-list at post ranged from $ES$ = 0.70 to $ES$ = 1.05. No effects were observed for generalized anxiety, although within-group evidence was found for a medium effect on depression one year after treatment. Overall, the two treatment conditions produced similar effects. \quad{}**Conclusions.** In general, participation increased healthy assertive expressions regardless of treatment condition, thereby reducing self-assessed social anxiety, and over time possibly also depression. Participation also improved general well-being. The findings demonstrate that the assertiveness construct can be a suitable target for intervention, with reductions of both psychiatric symptoms and non-syndromal problems in daily life. The study was preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04240249).
