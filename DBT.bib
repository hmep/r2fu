   abstract = {Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993) is a comprehensive and principle-based cognitive- behavioral intervention initially developed for the treatment of suicidal behavior and later expanded to the treatment of borderline personality disorder and additional psychiatric disorders associated with emotion dysregulation. As a comprehensive treatment, DBT consists of multiple modalities of intervention that include individual therapy, skills training, telephone consultation, team consultation, and the structuring of ancillary treatments. In the present article, we review three essential strategies expected to occur during an individual session of DBT. The three strategies reviewed include structuring the content of the session, core strategies of problem solving and validation, and dialectical strategies and worldview. Associated research data and clinical examples are provided for each strategy. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

Its development was a trial and error effort driven primarily from clinical experience. Dialectical behavior therapy is a modular and hierarchical treatment consisting of a combination of individual psychotherapy, group skills, training, telephone coaching, and a therapist consultation team. The inherent modularity and hierarchical structure of DBT has allowed for relative ease in adapting and applying the treatment to other populations and settings. New skills have been developed and/or modified due to clinical need and/or advancement in research such as treatment outcomes or mechanisms.

   abstract = {Dialectical Behaviour therapy (DBT) was originally developed for the treatment of women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) in the community. Since then DBT has been modified and evaluated for use with comorbid disorders, across the lifespan and across a range of clinical settings. The DBT model assumes that individuals with BPD lack key interpersonal, self-regulation, and distress tolerance skills, and that personal and environmental factors may frequently block and/or inhibit the use of behavioural skills or reinforce maladaptive actions. DBT is based on an assumption of a pervasive skills deficit; thus the therapy is designed to facilitate the learning of new skills, the embedding of these skills into the individual's repertoire, and the generalization of these skills across contexts. DBT incorporates a range of change-enhancing strategies interwoven with acceptance-focused strategies. DBT was developed from the cognitive-behavioural model of treatment, and thus shares many of its key components. DBT incorporates the principles of dialectics, mindfulness, and validation with cognitive-behavioural principles and techniques. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a novel treatment program, Dialectical Behavior Therapy for School Refusal (DBT-SR), that attempts to address limitations in both existing treatment models and current delivery systems. DBT-SR employs a multimodal approach to directly address the severe emotional and behavioral dysregulation mechanisms maintaining school refusal behavior. It also incorporates a web-based coaching component to provide active, real-time skills coaching to youth and parents at the times, and in the context, of greatest need (at home, during morning hours). A pilot trial and illustrative case examples provide "proof of concept" that DBT-SR is reasonably feasible and acceptable to clients and therapists and that web-based coaching provides incremental, unique benefit. Significant development remains, as participant recruitment proved a challenge in this trial. However, results suggest that DBT-SR is a promising, novel intervention that deserves further development.},

   abstract = {This study focused on the development and pilot testing of a protocol based on Prolonged Exposure (PE) that can be added to Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to treat PTSD in suicidal and self-injuring individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Women with BPD, PTSD, and recent and/or imminent serious intentional self-injury (n=13) received one year of DBT with the DBT PE Protocol, plus three months of follow up assessment. The treatment was associated with significant reductions in PTSD, with the majority of patients no longer meeting criteria for PTSD at post-treatment (71.4% of DBT PE Protocol completers, 60.0% of the intent-to-treat sample). A minority of patients (27.3%) engaged in intentional self-injury during the study. Improvements were also found for suicidal ideation, dissociation, trauma-related guilt cognitions, shame, anxiety, depression, and social adjustment. There was no evidence that the DBT PE Protocol led to exacerbations of intentional self-injury urges or behaviors, PTSD, treatment dropout, or crisis service use. Overall, the results indicate that this integrated BPD and PTSD treatment is feasible to implement within one year of treatment, highly acceptable to patients and therapists, safe to administer, and shows promise as an effective intervention for PTSD in this complex and high-risk patient population.},

The purposes of this review article of third wave treatment RCTs were: (1) to describe and review them methodologically, (2) to meta-analytically assess their efficacy, and (3) to evaluate if they currently fulfil the criteria for empirically supported treatments. There are 13 RCTs both in ACT and DBT, 1 in CBASP, 2 in IBCT, and none in FAP. The conclusions that can be drawn are that the third wave treatment RCTs used a research methodology that was significantly less stringent than CBT studies; that the mean effect size was moderate for both ACT and DBT, and that none of the third wave therapies fulfilled the criteria for empirically supported treatments. The article ends with suggestions on how to improve future RCTs to increase the possibility of them becoming empirically supported treatments.},

After the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased DBT skills use. We present a model based on qualitative findings of how Pocket Skills supported DBT. Pocket Skills helped participants engage in their DBT and practice and implement skills in their environmental context, which enabled them to see the results of using their DBT skills and increase their self-efficacy.

This study examined a group-based intervention for shame based on the principles of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in patients (N = 133; 61% female; M = 34 years old; 86% Caucasian) in a 28-day residential addictions treatment program. Method: Consecutive cohort pairs were assigned in a pairwise random fashion to receive treatment as usual (TAU) or the ACT intervention in place of 6 hr of treatment that would have occurred at that same time. The ACT intervention consisted of three 2-hr group sessions scheduled during a single week. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated that the ACT intervention resulted in smaller immediate gains in shame, but larger reductions at 4-month follow-up. Those attending the ACT group also evidenced fewer days of substance use and higher treatment attendance at follow-up. Effects of the ACT intervention on treatment utilization at follow-up were statistically mediated by posttreatment levels of shame, in that those evidencing higher levels of shame at posttreatment were more likely to be attending treatment at follow-up. Intervention effects on substance use at follow-up were mediated by treatment utilization at follow-up, suggesting that the intervention may have had its effects, at least in part, through improving treatment attendance. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that an approach to shame based on mindfulness and acceptance appears to produce better treatment attendance and reduced substance use. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

   abstract = {Dropout rates in trauma-focused treatments for adult posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are high. Most research has focused on demographic and pretreatment predictors of dropout, but findings have been inconsistent. We examined predictors of dropout in cognitive processing therapy (CPT) by coding the content of trauma narratives written in early sessions of CPT. Data are from a randomized controlled noninferiority trial of CPT and written exposure therapy (WET) in which CPT showed significantly higher dropout rates than WET (39.7% CPT vs. 6.4% WET). Participants were 51 adults with a primary diagnosis of PTSD who were receiving CPT and completed at least one of three narratives in the early sessions of CPT. Sixteen (31%) in this subsample were classified as dropouts and 35 as completers. An additional 9 participants dropped out but could not be included because they did not complete any narratives. Of the 11 participants who provided a reason for dropout, 82% reported that CPT was too distressing. The CHANGE coding system was used to code narratives for pathological trauma responses (cognitions, emotions, physiological responses) and maladaptive modes of processing (avoidance, ruminative processing, overgeneralization), each on a scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (high). Binary logistic regressions showed that, averaging across all available narratives, more negative emotions described during or around the time of the trauma predicted less dropout. More ruminative processing in the present time frame predicted lower rates of dropout, whereas more overgeneralized beliefs predicted higher rates. In the first impact statement alone, more negative emotions in the present time frame predicted lower dropout rates, but when emotional reactions had a physiological impact, dropout was higher. These findings suggest clinicians might attend to clients’ written trauma narratives in CPT in order to identify indicators of dropout risk and to help increase engagement.},

   abstract = {Background: Previous evidence has shown a strong relation between Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptomology and Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). The current study aimed to extend prior research by investigating the relationship between PTSD symptom clusters (arousal and intrusion) and NSSI, and putative moderators of this association within a large-scale adult sample in England. Method: A subsample of participants with experiences of trauma in adulthood (n = 2,480) from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2007 (APMS 2007) was utilised to examine the relations among PTSD intrusion and arousal symptom clusters, childhood interpersonal trauma, perceived social support and lifetime NSSI. Results: Arousal symptoms were consistently associated with NSSI, even when adjusting for multiple covariates, and had a stronger relationship than intrusion symptoms. Childhood interpersonal trauma was independently and significantly associated with lifetime NSSI after adjusting for covariates. The moderating effects of childhood interpersonal trauma and perceived social support were not statistically significant. Limitations: The study was cross-sectional and utilised self-report assessments to measure PTSD, NSSI, and childhood interpersonal trauma. Conclusion: Findings support the role of PTSD arousal and childhood interpersonal trauma in relation to NSSI. The moderating role of childhood interpersonal trauma and perceived social support lacks supporting evidence. Findings highlight the need for NSSI screening as well as for specific interventions that target the complex needs of those who exhibit elevated PTSD arousal symptoms, especially those with a history of childhood interpersonal trauma.},

Several studies have leveraged electronic health record (EHR) data to predict suicide risk in veteran and military samples; however, few studies have investigated suicide risk factors in a large-scale community health population. Methods: Clinical data was queried for 9,811 patients from the Penn Medicine Health System who had completed a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) documented in the EHR between January 2017 and June 2019. Patient demographics, PHQ-9 scores, and psychiatric comorbidities were extracted from the EHR. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were applied to determine significant risk factors associated with suicide ideation responses from the PHQ-9. Results: One-quarter (25.8%% of patients endorsed suicide ideation. Univariate analysis found 22 risk factors of suicide ideation. Multivariable logistic regression found significant positive associations (Odds Ratio, (95% Confidence Interval)) with the following: younger ages less than 18 years: 2.1, (1.69, 2.60) and 19-24 years: 1.55, (1.29, 1.87)), single marital status (1.22, (1.08, 1.38)), African American (1.22, (1.08, 1.38)), non-commercial insurance (1.16, (1.03, 1.31)), multiple comorbidities (1 comorbidity (1.65, (1.32, 2.07); 2 comorbidities (2.07, (1.61, 2.64)), 3+ comorbidities (2.49, (1.87, 3.33))), bipolar disorders (Type I: 1.38, (1.14, 1.67) and Type II: 1.94, (1.52, 2.49)), depressive disorders (1.70, (1.49, 1.94)), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (1.43, (1.08, 1.90)), and stress disorders (1.53, (1.33, 1.76)).

   abstract = {Because little research has been conducted on which therapist-client interactions lead to intermediate and end-point improvements in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), we have a small evidence-base from which to specify what therapists must know and do in order to obtain good outcomes using DBT. As with other evidence-based practices, dissemination of DBT has defaulted to assumptions and methods from the "psychother-apy technology model," which emphasizes transfer of the validated treatment package from the research clinic to routine settings with high fidelity (Morgenstern & McKay, 2007). However, serious limitations of the psychotherapy technology model require pursuit of alternative complementary models to guide dissemination. One complementary approach is to use well-designed practice-based training research. In this approach , therapists learn modular competencies linked to a highly structured yet flexible clinical decision-making framework. Modular training of therapist competencies emphasizes the continuity of the component therapist strategies across evidence-based protocols rather than emphasizing the packages or manuals as separate and distinct. Key hypotheses about the change processes responsible for client change and the associated treatment strategies used to influence these change processes should be specified and measured at the level of client, therapist, and service delivery setting. Adopting this approach may offer advantages that apply to the dissemination and implementation of DBT and other evidence-based practices (EBPs). dialectical behavior therapy is a cognitive-behavioral treatment for pervasive emotion dysregulation whose mechanisms of action we do not yet understand Research evaluating Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) protocols include well-controlled and independent randomized clinical trials showing that DBT reduced suicide attempts, suicide ideation, and nonsuicidal self-injury, improved treatment retention, improved quality of life, increased the use of behavioral skills and, when targeted, improved criterion behaviors of Axis I disorders. (For reviews of empirical literature see Kliem, Kröger, & Kosfelder, 2010; Robins & Chapman, 2004; Stoffers et al., 2012). Although the evidence suggests that DBT may improve important client outcomes, as with other psychotherapies, existing data fail to specify which therapist-client interactions lead to intermediate and end-point improvements. Little is known about moderators of treatment effects (what works for whom under what conditions?), the necessary and sufficient procedural components of effectiveness, mechanisms of change, or the necessary level of integrity to a DBT protocol required to obtain good outcomes. Consequently, we do not have a robust, evidence-based answer about what therapists must know and do in order to obtain good outcomes using DBT. what theory and procedure, then, should be trained to maximize the chances that therapists get good outcomes using dbt? In the absence of a robust evidence-based answer, the dissemination of DBT has used default assumptions of what Morgenstern and McKay (2007) have called the "psychotherapy technology model." This model is based on the assumptions that psychotherapies},

Recent Findings Evidence-based advances in the treatment of BPD include a delineation of generalist models of care in contrast to specialist treatments, identification of essential effective elements of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and the adaptation of DBT treatment to manage post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and BPD. Studies on pharmacological interventions remain limited and have not provided evidence that any specific medications can provide stand-alone treatment. Summary The research on treatment in BPD is leading to a distillation of intensive packages of treatment to be more broadly and practically implemented in most treatment environments through generalist care models and pared down forms of intensive treatments (e.g., informed case management plus DBT skills training groups). Evidence-based integrations of DBT and exposure therapy for PTSD provide support for changing practices to simultaneously treat PTSD and BPD.},

   abstract = {Several manualized psychotherapies for treating borderline personality disorder (BPD) have been validated in randomized, controlled trials. Most of these approaches are highly specialized, offering different formulation of BPD and different mechanisms by which recovery is made possible. Mental health clinicians are challenged by the degree of specialization and clinical resources that these approaches require in their empirically validated adherent forms. While these effective treatments have renewed optimism for the treatment of BPD, clinicians may feel limited in their ability to offer any of them or may integrate an eclectic assortment of features from the different treatments. This article will evaluate four major evidence-based treatments for BPD—dialectical behavioral therapy, mentalization-based treatment, transference-focused psychotherapy, and General Psychiatric Management—and possible modes of implementation in adherent and integrative forms. Models of implementing these diverse treatment approaches will be evaluated, and the potential advantages of combining evidence-based treatments will be discussed, along with some cautionary notes. A proposal for providing stepwise care through assessment of clinical severity will be presented as a means of achieving system-wide changes and greater access to care.},

   abstract = {The authors review four theories that propose different conceptualizations of borderline personality disorder's (BPD) core psychopathology: excess aggression, emotional dysregulation, failed mentalization, and interpersonal hypersensitivity. The theories are compared in their ability to explain BPD's coaggregation of four usually distinct sectors of psychopathology, their high overlap with other disorders, their ability to distinguish BPD from other disorders, their integration of heritability, and their clinical applicability. The aims of this review are to increase awareness of these theories, to stimulate improved theories, and to foster testable hypotheses so that research can advance our knowledge about BPD's core. At present there are multiple theories about what comprises the core of borderline personality disorder (BPD) psychopathology, each with distinctive features and each with an associated model of treatment. We will examine the distinctions between four major theories of BPD and assess their relative merits (Table 1). These four theories were selected because each defines an organizing core for BPD, all have associated and widely recognized models for psychotherapy, and each model is taught by an active, influential, and committed faculty. Moreover, each theory has a significant body of research that supports its claims (uses five standards for evaluating BPD's theories. In the absence of standards for such comparison, these were chosen because of their clinical relevance and significance and because of their feasibility for comparison. The first standard considers their ability to explain the coaggregation of BPD's four component sectors: interpersonal, affective, behavioral, and self/ cognitive. The second standard addresses BPD's high rates of comorbidity with other disorders-how well does each theory account for these over-laps? The third standard is whether a theory distinguishes BPD from other},

   abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o The premise of the standard regulatory model, "homeostasis", is flawed: the goal of regulation is not to preserve constancy of the internal milieu. Rather, it is to continually adjust the milieu to promote survival and reproduction. Regulatory mechanisms need to be efficient, but homeostasis (error-correction by feedback) is inherently inefficient. Thus, although feedbacks are certainly ubiquitous, they could not possibly serve as the primary regulatory mechanism. A newer model, "allostasis", proposes that efficient regulation requires anticipating needs and preparing to satisfy them before they arise. The advantages: (i) errors are reduced in magnitude and frequency; (ii) response capacities of different components are matched-to prevent bottlenecks and reduce safety factors; (iii) resources are shared between systems to minimize reserve capacities; (iv) errors are remembered and used to reduce future errors. This regulatory strategy requires a dedicated organ, the brain. The brain tracks multitudinous variables and integrates their values with prior knowledge to predict needs and set priorities. The brain coordinates effectors to mobilize resources from modest bodily stores and enforces a system of flexible trade-offs: from each organ according to its ability, to each organ according to its need. The brain also helps regulate the internal milieu by governing anticipatory behavior. Thus, an animal conserves energy by moving to a warmer place-before it cools, and it conserves salt and water by moving to a cooler one before it sweats. The behavioral strategy requires continuously updating a set of specific "shopping lists" that document the growing need for each key component (warmth, food, salt, water). These appetites funnel into a common pathway that employs a "stick" to drive the organism toward filling the need, plus a "carrot" to relax the organism when the need is satisfied. The stick corresponds broadly to the sense of anxiety, and the carrot broadly to the sense of pleasure. This design constrains anxieties to be non-adapting and pleasures to be brief-fast-adapting-to make way for the next anxiety. The stick/carrot mechanisms evolved early and expanded so that in humans they govern higher level learning and social organization. Correspondingly, the "funnel" widened to allow innumerable activities and experiences to each provide non-adapting anxieties and brief pleasures, their reward values depending partly on the effort expended. But modern life narrows the variety of small pleasures and reduces effort, thereby reducing their reward value and requiring larger portions for equivalent satisfaction-a cycle that generates addictive behaviors. Homeostasis and allostasis locate pathology at different levels. Homeostasis identifies proximate causes; for example, it attributes essential hypertension to excess salt water in too small a vascular reservoir. Thus it directs pharmacotherapy toward reducing salt and water, expanding the reservoir, and blocking feedbacks that would counteract these measures. Allostasis attributes essential hypertension to the brain. Chronically anticipating a need for higher pressure, the brain mobilizes all the low level mechanisms in concert: kidney to retain salt and water, vascular system to tighten, and salt appetite to rise. Correspondingly, allostasis would direct therapy toward higher levels-to reduce demand and increase sense of control-so that the brain can down-shift its prediction and relax all the low-level mechanisms in concert. For disorders of addiction homeostasis pursues pharmacological treatments: drugs to treat drug addiction, obesity, and other compulsive behaviors. Allostasis suggests broader approaches-such as re-expanding the range of possible pleasures and providing opportunities to expend effort in their pursuit.},

This paper describes the role of family interactions or processes, especially those that might be regarded as invalidating or conflictual, negative or critical, and the absence of more validating, positive, supportive, empathic interactions, in the development of BPD. Perhaps more importantly, the proposed model considers how these parental and family behaviors transact with the child's own behaviors and emotional vulnerabilities, resulting in a developmental model of BPD that is neither blaming of the family member with BPD nor of her or his parents and caregivers, and has important and specific implications for both prevention and intervention.},

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a non-invasive marker of the influence of the myelinated vagal fibers on the heart, and heart period were collected during the presentation of film clips of varying emotional content. The BPD and control groups had similar initial levels of RSA and heart period. However, during the experiment the groups exhibited contrasting trajectories, with the BPD group decreasing RSA and heart period and the control group increasing RSA and heart period. By the end of the experiment, the groups differ significantly on both RSA and heart period. The correlation between the changes in RSA and heart period was significant only for the control group, suggesting that vagal mechanisms mediated the heart period responses only in the control group. The findings were consistent with the Polyvagal Theory [Porges, S. W. (1995). Orienting in a defensive world: Mammalian modifications of our evolutionary heritage: A Polyvagal Theory.

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment for suicidal individuals. However, DBT consists of multiple components, including individual therapy, skills training, telephone coaching, and a therapist consultation team, and little is known about which components are needed to achieve positive outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the importance of the skills training component of DBT by comparing skills training plus case management (DBT-S), DBT individual therapy plus activities group (DBT-I), and standard DBT which includes skills training and individual therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a single-blind randomized clinical trial from April 24, 2004, through January 26, 2010, involving 1 year of treatment and 1 year of follow-up. Participants included 99 women (mean age, 30.3 years; 69 [71%] white) with borderline personality disorder who had at least 2 suicide attempts and/or nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) acts in the last 5 years, an NSSI act or suicide attempt in the 8 weeks before screening, and a suicide attempt in the past year. We used an adaptive randomization procedure to assign participants to each condition. Treatment was delivered from June 3, 2004, through September 29, 2008, in a university-affiliated clinic and community settings by therapists or case managers. Outcomes were evaluated quarterly by blinded assessors. We hypothesized that standard DBT would outperform DBT-S and DBT-I. INTERVENTIONS: The study compared standard DBT, DBT-S, and DBT-I. Treatment dose was controlled across conditions, and all treatment providers used the DBT suicide risk assessment and management protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequency and severity of suicide attempts and NSSI episodes. RESULTS: All treatment conditions resulted in similar improvements in the frequency and severity of suicide attempts, suicide ideation, use of crisis services due to suicidality, and reasons for living. Compared with the DBT-I group, interventions that included skills training resulted in greater improvements in the frequency of NSSI acts (F1,85 = 59.1 [P < .001] for standard DBT and F1,85 = 56.3 [P < .001] for DBT-S) and depression (t 399 = 1.8[P = .03] for standard DBT and t399 = 2.9[P = .004] for DBT-S) during the treatment year. In addition, anxiety significantly improved during the treatment year in standard DBT (t94 = -3.5 [P < .001]) and DBT-S (t94 = -2.6[P = .01]), but not in DBT-I. Compared with the DBT-I group, the standard DBT group had lower dropout rates from treatment (8 patients [24%] vs 16 patients [48%] [P = .04]), and patients were less likely to use crisis services in follow-up (ED visits, 1 [3%] vs 3 [13%] [P = .02]; psychiatric hospitalizations, 1 [3%] vs 3 [13%] [P = .03]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A variety of DBT interventions with therapists trained in the DBT suicide risk assessment and management protocol are effective for reducing suicide attempts and NSSI episodes. Interventions that include DBT skills training are more effective than DBT without skills training, and standard DBT may be superior in some areas.

   abstract = {This study focused on the development and pilot testing of a protocol based on Prolonged Exposure (PE) that can be added to Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to treat PTSD in suicidal and self-injuring individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Women with BPD, PTSD, and recent and/or imminent serious intentional self-injury (n=13) received one year of DBT with the DBT PE Protocol, plus three months of follow up assessment. The treatment was associated with significant reductions in PTSD, with the majority of patients no longer meeting criteria for PTSD at post-treatment (71.4% of DBT PE Protocol completers, 60.0% of the intent-to-treat sample). A minority of patients (27.3%) engaged in intentional self-injury during the study. Improvements were also found for suicidal ideation, dissociation, trauma-related guilt cognitions, shame, anxiety, depression, and social adjustment. There was no evidence that the DBT PE Protocol led to exacerbations of intentional self-injury urges or behaviors, PTSD, treatment dropout, or crisis service use. Overall, the results indicate that this integrated BPD and PTSD treatment is feasible to implement within one year of treatment, highly acceptable to patients and therapists, safe to administer, and shows promise as an effective intervention for PTSD in this complex and high-risk patient population.},

   abstract = {D ialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a well-established treatment for individuals with multiple and severe psychosocial disorders , including those who are chronically suicidal. Because many such patients have substance use disorders (SUDs), the authors developed DBT for Substance Abusers, which incorporates concepts and modalities designed to promote abstinence and to reduce the length and adverse impact of relapses. Among these are dialectical abstinence, "clear mind," and attachment strategies that include off-site counseling as well as active attempts to find patients who miss sessions. Several randomized clinical trials have found that DBT for Substance Abusers decreased substance abuse in patients with borderline personality disorder. The treatment also may be helpful for patients who have other severe disorders co-occurring with SUDs or who have not responded to other evidence-based SUD therapies. D eveloped by coauthor Dr. Marsha M. Linehan, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a comprehensive treatment program whose ultimate goal is to aid patients in their efforts to build a life worth living. When DBT is successful, the patient learns to envision, articulate, pursue, and sustain goals that are independent of his or her history of out-of-control behavior, including substance abuse, and is better able to grapple with life's ordinary problems. DBT's emphasis on building a life worth living is a broader therapeutic goal than reduction in problem behaviors, symptom management, or palliative care. The word dialectic refers to the synthesis of two opposites. The fundamental principle of DBT is to create a dynamic that promotes two opposed goals for patients: change and acceptance. This conceptual framing evolved in response to a dilemma that arose in the course of trying to develop an effective treatment for suicidal patients. Dr. Linehan's basic premise for DBT was that people who wanted to be dead did not have the requisite skills to solve the problems that were causing their profound suffering and build a life worth living. However, a sole emphasis on promoting behavioral change quickly proved unworkable. Many patients were exquisitely sensitive to criticism; when prompted to change, they responded by shutting down emotionally or by exhibiting increased, sometimes overwhelming emotional arousal-for example, storming out of sessions or, occasionally, even attacking the therapist. At the same time, dropping the emphasis on change and instead encouraging patients to accept and tolerate situations and feelings that distressed them produced equally negative consequences. Patients then viewed their thera},

   abstract = {Background: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has demonstrated efficacy in treating disorders such as alcohol dependence that are characterized by emotional dysregulation. Preliminary evidence has revealed the feasibility of DBT skills training (ST) as a stand-alone treatment for such disorders. Although emotional dysregulation plays a significant role in alcohol dependence, there are no previous reports of using DBT-ST to treat it. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the duration of abstinence and changes in emotional regulation in a 3-month DBT-ST program for alcohol-dependent patients and to look for relations between abstinence and emotional regulation. Methods: We administered the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and used urine toxicology screening to monitor alcohol/substance intake among the 244 subjects admitted to the program. Results: Among the 157 patients who completed the treatment, 73.2% were abstinent at the end of the program, and their emotional regulation improved. Improvement was independent of the initial severity of both alcohol use and emotional dysregulation. For substance use outcomes, we found a partial mediation role of improved emotional regulation. Conclusions: This is the first open trial to show improved alcohol-related behavior and emotional regulation in alcohol-dependent patients treated with DBT-ST and to posit a partial but significant relation between improved emotional regulation and alcohol use outcomes. In the treatment of alcohol dependence, emotional regulation may be a relevant factor for therapists to consider.},

   abstract = {Background: Research on dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) or 12-step programmes has shown inconclusive results; no systematic review has directly compared the two. Objectives: The goals of this meta-analytic review were to assess if DBT is more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) and if DBT is more effective than 12-step programmes (including twelve-step facilitation [TSF] and self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous) for substance use disorder (SUD). Methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and extracted data on the following outcomes: reduction in substance use, retention in treatment, severity of substance dependence/abuse and severity of mental health symptoms. Studies involved adult (>18 years) women with SUD, according to DSM-5 or the equivalent diagnoses in DSM-IV. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria and contained appropriate data for meta-analysis (75 participants). Results: No significant effects of DBT have been found compared to 12-step programmes. Comparing DBT with TAU, we found a beneficial short-term (1 RCT, n = 12, SMD = −0.84; 95% CI [−1.64, −0.04]) and long-term (2 RCTs, n = 29, SMD = −1.26; 95% CI [−2.13, −0.40]) effect of DBT on severity of substance use. Conclusions: Despite the limited evidence of the present review, contextual evidence supports DBT and 12-step programmes. RCTs with larger sample sizes are needed to better elucidate the impact of both treatments on SUD and facilitate the comparison between DBT and 12 steps programmes.},

Results indicated that ED-SUD patients had a higher number of psychiatric comorbidities, were more likely to be prescribed mood stabilizers, and were more sensitive to reward. They also reported greater difficulty with emotion regulation, including more difficulty engaging in goal-directed activity, higher impulsivity, and more limited access to emotion regulation strategies. These differences highlight the importance of targeting emotion dysregulation for ED-SUD, and provide evidence for the importance of integrated, transdiagnostic treatment to simultaneously address the SUD, ED, and other psychiatric comorbidities.
